# Zombie-Apocalypse Video Game | Z-Lock

## Objective
This Video Game was first developed for a class project, however it was modified further to be what it is today. I worked on this with one other teammate, while I took lead on the programming side, she took responsibility for the art. The storyline of this video game is one of a Zombie Apocalypse. It is a man who is trapped in a maze like building and tries to escape the zombies by trying to get to the 1st floor. All he needs to do is collect the keys and get out of there fast!

- Depending on the floor (on the level) the number of Zombies increases and time decreases. There are four objects a player can collect:
  - **A Key:** 3 keys are on each floor, each key needs to be collected before the time runs out. 
  - **A Brain:** gives user more time (considering that zombies love eating brain :))
  - **A Syringe:** gives user more health and therefore more time.
  - **A Rotten Apple:** gives user less life (less health) and less time.
